<p style="text-align: center;">On Christmas Eve of 2021 Beach hosting Saturday major hack as several servers did. Since then Beach hosting has been dormant and nothing has happened with it this is very unfortunate because we have lost the potential of the business. This year we have no plans on returning Beach hosting back to its original state. There was a lot done to that business and development team over the years. Beach hosting came apart of the echo development family back in 2020 since then we have only guided where they go. Well starting soon will be redoing the entire discord we have no plans to go away from the cad industry. But we have also no plans to add all 61 cads back on the discord along with all of the other products will simply be adding a channel for each section of product back to the discord. With links to our website we're all descriptions and prices will be located. We also plan to help them get into the discord bot community so this way they can start selling the code linked to discord bots more to come on this soon. We hope this enlightens everybody on what's been going on with Beach hosting and we plan to move forward with it thank you.</p>
